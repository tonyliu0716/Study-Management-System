# Study-Management-System

What study management system can do:

1. after study management system running on the local machine, it's already connected to the Open edX server.

2. Teachers can plan their students' study by themselve. All they need is the excel/CSV file that contains their student school,
class name, first name, last name.

3. After uploading the file to study management system, 
__SMS would generate the Open edX accounts for all the students, also automatically register the teacher's courses for them__.

_In this case, they don't need to do the (sign-up, sign-in, activate their account) steps._

This is a powerful tools that has been used in 5 schools studies.

__Notice: it won't work properly unless the machine that host SMS inside TAMU network.__
